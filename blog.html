        What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that
          represents the structure of a document, such as an HTML or XML file,
          as a tree of objects. Each node in this tree corresponds to different
          parts of the document, including elements, attributes, and text,
          allowing developers to easily navigate and manipulate the content and
          structure of a webpage. Through the DOM, developers can create dynamic
          and interactive user experiences by responding to events, modifying
          content in real-time, and changing the appearance of elements. While
          the DOM is designed to be language-agnostic, it is most commonly
          manipulated using JavaScript in web development, providing a powerful
          way to enhance the functionality and interactivity of web
          applications.

        How do you select an element from the DOM?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          To select an element from the DOM, you can use various methods
          provided by the JavaScript API. One of the most common methods is
          `document.getElementById()`, which allows you to retrieve an element
          based on its unique ID. Another widely used method is
          `document.querySelector()`, which enables you to select the first
          element that matches a specified CSS selector, making it versatile for
          selecting elements by class, tag, or other attributes. If you want to
          select multiple elements, you can use `document.querySelectorAll()`,
          which returns a NodeList of all elements that match the given
          selector. Additionally, you can traverse the DOM tree using properties
          like `parentNode`, `childNodes`, and `nextSibling` to access related
          elements. These methods provide a robust way to interact with and
          manipulate the elements of a webpage as needed.

        What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
        useful?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          Event delegation is a technique in the context of the DOM that allows
          a single event listener to manage events for multiple child elements
          rather than attaching individual listeners to each element. This is
          achieved by setting the event listener on a common ancestor element
          and utilizing the event bubbling phase to capture events that
          originate from its child elements. This approach is useful for several
          reasons: it reduces memory consumption by minimizing the number of
          event listeners needed, enhances performance, especially in scenarios
          with a large number of child elements, and simplifies the management
          of dynamic content since new child elements automatically inherit the
          event listener without requiring additional setup. By leveraging event
          delegation, developers can create more efficient and maintainable code
          while also ensuring consistent behavior across a range of user
          interactions.

        How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          To manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM, you
          can utilize various properties and methods provided by the JavaScript
          API. To change an element's attributes, you can use the
          `setAttribute()` method, which allows you to specify the attribute
          name and its new value, or directly access properties on the element,
          such as `element.id` or `element.className`. For example, if you want
          to modify the `src` attribute of an image, you can do so with
          `element.setAttribute('src', 'newImage.jpg')`. To adjust an element's
          styles, you can manipulate the `style` property, allowing you to set
          CSS styles directly in JavaScript. For instance, you can change the
          background color of an element with `element.style.backgroundColor =
          'blue'`. This combination of methods and properties enables developers
          to create dynamic and responsive interfaces by updating attributes and
          styles based on user interactions or application logic.
